# GenerativeAI Projects

Welcome to the GenerativeAI repository! This repository contains a collection of projects demonstrating the capabilities of Generative AI across various levels of complexity: basic, intermediate, and advanced. Each folder contains projects with detailed explanations, code, and resources to help you learn and explore Generative AI.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main folders based on the complexity of the projects:

- [Basic](#basic)
- [Intermediate](#intermediate)
- [Advanced](#advanced)

### Basic

The `Basic` folder contains introductory projects suitable for beginners who are new to Generative AI. These projects focus on fundamental concepts and simple implementations.

#### Projects:
1. **Project 1: ImageToTextGenerator**
   - Description: Image Captioning with Vision-Encoder-Decoder Model.
   - Files: `imagetotextgenerator.py`, `README.md`
   - Dependencies: `transformers`, `torch`

2. **Project 2: TextToImageGenerator**
   - Description: Create images with just an prompt.
   - Files: `texttoimagegenerator.py`, `README.md`
   - Dependencies: `torch`, `pandas`, `diffusers`, `numpy`, `transformers`, `matplotlib`, `cv2`

### Intermediate

The `Intermediate` folder contains projects that require a moderate understanding of Generative AI concepts. These projects are more complex and may involve custom model training and fine-tuning.

#### Projects:
1. **Project 1: MultiLingualTextToImageGenerator**
   - Description: The script translates from any text to English and generates an image from the translated prompt using Stable Diffusion..
   - Files: `multilingualtexttoimagegenerator.py`, `README.md`
   - Dependencies: `torch`, `pandas`, `diffusers`, `numpy`, `transformers`, `matplotlib`, `cv2`

### Advanced

The `Advanced` folder contains projects that involve cutting-edge techniques and require a deep understanding of Generative AI. These projects may include complex architectures, large-scale datasets, and advanced training techniques.

#### Projects:
1. **Project 1: Langchain based Chat Retrival Chatbot**
   - Description: This script creates a Streamlit app that uses LangChain components to provide conversational insights about Mumbai properties.
   - Files: `app.py`, `README.md`
   - Dependencies: `langchain`, `streamlit`

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects, follow the instructions in the respective project folder's `README.md` file. Each project includes step-by-step instructions for setup, execution, and experimentation.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)
- Required dependencies (listed in each project's `README.md`)
