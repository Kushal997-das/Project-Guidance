# Llama

LlaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) is a Generative AI model, specifically a group of foundational Large Language Models developed by Meta AI, a company owned by Meta(Formerly Facebook). Meta announced Llama in Feb of 2023. Meta released Llama in different sizes(based on parameters), i.e., 7,13,33, and 65 billion parameters with a context length of 2k tokens. The model is with the intent to help researchers advance their knowledge in the field of AI. The small 7B models allow researchers with low computation power to study these models.

# Llama 2

LlaMA 2 surpasses the previous version, LlaMA version 1, which Meta released in July of 2023. It came out in three sizes: 7B, 13B, and 70B parameter models. Upon its release, LlaMA 2 achieved the highest score on Hugging Face. Even across all segments (7B, 13B, and 70B), the top-performing model on Hugging Face originates from LlaMA 2, having been fine-tuned or retrained.

This release includes model weights and starting code for pretrained and fine-tuned Llama language models ‚Äî ranging from 7B to 70B parameters.

## Download

The source code for Llama 2 is available on GitHub. If you want to work with the original weights, these are also available, but for this, you need to provide your name and email to the Meta AIs website. So go to the Meta AI by [clicking here](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/), then enter your name, email address, and organization(student if you are not working). Then scroll down and click on accept and continue. Now you will get a mail stating that you can download the model weights

### Access on Hugging Face

We are also providing downloads on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-GGML/tree/main). You must first request a download from the Meta website using the same email address as your Hugging Face account. After doing so, you can request access to any of the models on Hugging Face and within 1-2 days your account will be granted access to all versions.
