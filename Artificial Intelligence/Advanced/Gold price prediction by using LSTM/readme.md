## Gold Price Prediction

### Project Overview

This project aims to predict the price of gold using various machine learning models. The project includes data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

### Requirements

1. **Data Retrieval:**
   - Collect historical gold price data from a reliable source.

2. **Data Exploration:**
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution and patterns.
   - Visualize the data to identify trends and relationships.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Create new features that could improve the model's performance.
   - Handle missing values and perform data normalization/standardization.

4. **Model Training:**
   - Train various machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, LSTM).
   - Use `train_test_split` to create training and testing datasets.
   - Apply techniques like cross-validation to improve model robustness.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, R2 score).
   - Compare the performance of different models.
   - Visualize the model predictions against actual values.

### Libraries and Tools

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow` and `keras` (for LSTM model)
- Any other relevant libraries for data processing and model training

### Approach

1. **Data Retrieval:**
   - Collect historical gold price data from a reliable source such as Yahoo Finance, Quandl, or other financial data providers.

2. **Data Exploration:**
   - Load the data into a DataFrame and inspect the first few rows.
   - Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
   - Perform statistical analysis to summarize the data.
   - Create visualizations (e.g., line plots, histograms, box plots) to understand data trends and distributions.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Generate additional features like moving averages, rolling statistics, and lag features.
   - Normalize or standardize the data to improve model performance.
   - Encode categorical features if any.

4. **Model Training:**
   - Split the data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.
   - Train various machine learning models:
     - **Linear Regression**
     - **Decision Trees**
     - **Random Forest**
     - **LSTM** (using TensorFlow and Keras)
   - Perform cross-validation to ensure model robustness.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate each model using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R2 score.
   - Visualize the predictions of each model against actual gold prices.
   - Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
