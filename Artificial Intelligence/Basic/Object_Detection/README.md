# Object Detection

# What is Object Detection
Object detection is a computer vision technique that allows us to identify and locate objects in an image or video. With this kind of identification and localization, object detection can be used to count objects in a scene and determine and track their precise locations, all while accurately labeling them.


This is a basic Object Detection project that uses ssd_mobilenet pretrained model, OpenCV and Matplotlib for Object detection of images. 

## Libraries Used : 
- OpenCV
- MatplotLib

## Pretrained Model used : 
- cv2.dnn_DetectionModel

## Steps being followed : 
- Importing libraries
- Loading the pretrained model
- Read the labels
- Configure the model
- Read the image
- Image Detection
- Boundary Box on the final image
- Display Output image

## Example 1 : 
- Input Image : 
 <img width="500" height = "300" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73430464/156656063-96b70957-fd38-4937-82ef-6aa9b272e715.png">
- Output Image : 
  <img width="500" height = "300" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73430464/156656101-3832080b-7eae-4ec1-bdee-2a71b0e0e4a1.png">
