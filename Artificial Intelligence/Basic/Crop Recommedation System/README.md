## About
This application assists farmers in selecting the optimal crop to cultivate, considering soil composition and environmental conditions.
By providing information such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels, as well as temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall, users receive tailored recommendations 
for the most suitable crop out of a selection of 22 options.
This is a supervised multi-class classification problem.
The recommendation is made using a Random Forest model trained on agricultural data. This model considers various factors to predict the best crop for your field. The model has been developed by analyzing many models like SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes. Random Forest has been selected based on the Cross Validation Accuracy & Test Accuracy
