# Audio to Indian Sign Language(ISL) Translator

Sign language is a visual language that is the native language of deaf people. In contrast to sound patterns, sign language combines body language and manual communication to transmit a person's thoughts in a fluid manner. Due of the length of time required to learn Sign Language, it is difficult for people to connect with those with special needs, resulting in a communication gap. Thus, this application accepts live speech or audio recordings as input, transforms them to text, and displays the corresponding clips in <b>Indian Sign Language</b>.


In this project, I have tried to develop a software that would be helpful for the disabled people having communication difficulties by developing a system that would help them in expressing themselves clearly and easily.

Our model takes an Audio input and converts it to text, which will then be parsed and converted to Indian sign language and displayed. It is a project in Social domain which will benefit the society.

The target audience for this system is not limited to hearing impaired individuals as communication for hearing impaired people in common places like railway stations, bus stands, banks, hospitals etc is very difficult because a vocal person may not understand sign language and thus wonâ€™t be able to convey any message to hearing impaired person. Thus, it is targeted to all those who wish to learn this translation, to facilitate better communication.
