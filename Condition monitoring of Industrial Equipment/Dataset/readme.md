## Description 
This data set was generated with the C-MAPSS simulator. C-MAPSS stands for 'Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation' and it is a tool for the simulation of realistic large commercial turbofan engine data. Each flight is a combination of a series of flight conditions with a reasonable linear transition period to allow the engine to change from one flight condition to the next. The flight conditions are arranged to cover a typical ascent from sea level to 35K ft and descent back down to sea level. The fault was injected at a given time in one of the flights and persists throughout the remaining flights, effectively increasing the age of the engine. The intent is to identify which flight and when in the flight the fault occurred.

The data provided is from a high fidelity system level engine simulation designed to simulate nominal and fault engine degradation over a series of flights. The simulated data was created with a Matlab Simulink tool called C-MAPSS.
