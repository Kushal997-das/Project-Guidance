## About The Project
The U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine determined that an adequate daily fluid intake is:  **About 15.5 cups (3.7 liters) of fluids a day for men**  and  **About 11.5 cups (2.7 liters) of fluids a day for women**.

We all know that water is extremely important for the proper functioning of the human body and the benefits of drinking water are countless, even after knowing all this we barely make it to about 2L of water per day.  
We are so glued to our computer screen that we do not even get up to get a glass of water. Knowing all the heath hazard linked to not drinking enough water, I decided to create a simple yet effective program which can remind you to  **Take a break**  and  **encourage you to drink a glass of water**.

### Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Only thing required is to mention the location the location of the icon image:
```sh
   app_icon="<location of the icon.ico file>", timeout=12)
   ```
### Installation

1. Download main.py, and icon.ico file and keep them in the same folder.
2. Use any Python text editor to change the parameters as per your needs. For example the time interval between each notification can be controlled by changing the value of the below mentioned command:
   ```sh
   time.sleep(60*60)
   ```

The program can be executed in two ways:
* Direct execution : Just like any other python program, this program can be executed using the terminal and executing main.py or you can also you text editors for this purpose.
The program will terminate if the execution is stopped or the code editor is closed and thus to get notified even after closing the terminal we can use the second method.

* To execute the program in the background : One way is to use **pythonw**, pythonw is the concatenation of python+without terminal window, i.e. run python without terminal window. You can use it by running the following line on the terminal:
   ```sh
   pythonw main.py
   ```
