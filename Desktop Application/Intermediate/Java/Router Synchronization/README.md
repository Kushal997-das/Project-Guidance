###### Router Synchronization Project

This project implements the concept of synchronization in java

###### Description

It is required to simulate a limited number of devices connected to a routerâ€™s Wi-Fi using Java threading and semaphore. Routers can be designed to limit the number of open connections.
For example, a Router may wish to have only N connections at any point in time. As soon as N connections are made,
the Router will not accept other incoming connection until an existing connection is released.

###### Parameters

* Number of WI-FI Connections
* Number of Devices

-> Can choose between Console Application and GUI Application once running the program.
