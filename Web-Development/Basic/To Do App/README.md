#To Do Django app

I wrote the game using the built in functions django supplies,
as well as a made html and css files while tuning them to the specific needs

done, pick a date choose add task and it's done

I used the Django framework for all backend functions, getting post requests,
setting the urls and building the models.
I used an html template to set up front end functions.
I used a css template to set up the style of the web app.
