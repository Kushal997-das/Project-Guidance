Swaping a number, means ?

It means if "A" is a bucket storing cashews and "B" is a bucket storing almonds, 
The objective is to store cashews in B and almonds in A 

Thus we'll introduce a new bucket "C", which shall be empty, and by using it, we may make the change.

The same logic has been applied here for swapping the numbers.
