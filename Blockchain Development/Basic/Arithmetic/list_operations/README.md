# SimpleList Smart Contract

This is a simple Ethereum smart contract implemented in Solidity. It allows users to manage a list of items by adding and removing them. The contract emits events when items are added or removed, providing transparency in transactions.

## Features

- **Add Item:** Users can add items to the list.
- **Remove Item:** Users can remove items from the list by specifying the index.
- **Get Item Count:** Users can retrieve the total number of items in the list.
- **Get Item by Index:** Users can retrieve a specific item by its index.
- **Get All Items:** Users can retrieve the entire list of items.

## Prerequisites

To deploy and interact with this contract, you will need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12 or higher)
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) for development and testing
- An Ethereum wallet (like MetaMask) for deployment

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/https://github.com/Kushal997-das/Project-Guidance/tree/main/Blockchain%20Development/Basic/Arithmetic/list-operations.git
   cd list-operations
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Compile the Contract:**
   Using Truffle:
   ```bash
   truffle compile
   ```

   Or using Hardhat:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

4. **Deploy the Contract:**
   Make sure you have your Ethereum wallet set up and the appropriate network selected (e.g., Rinkeby test network).
   Using Truffle:
   ```bash
   truffle migrate --network rinkeby
   ```

   Or using Hardhat:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
   ```

5. **Interact with the Contract:**
   You can interact with the deployed contract using a frontend application or directly through the console provided by Truffle or Hardhat.

## Events

- **ItemAdded:** Emitted when a new item is added to the list.
- **ItemRemoved:** Emitted when an item is removed from the list.
