# SimplePyBlockchain

A basic blockchain implementation in Python with Proof of Work consensus.

## Description

SimplePyBlockchain is a basic blockchain project implemented in Python. It demonstrates the concept of a blockchain and uses a simple Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. This project is intended for educational purposes and to help you understand the basic principles of a blockchain.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

- `blockchain.py`: Contains the implementation of the Block and Blockchain classes, along with the PoW algorithm.
- `main.py`: A simple script demonstrating how to create and use the blockchain.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
   git clone https://github.com/devincapriola/SimplePyBlockchain.git
   ```


3. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd SimplePyBlockchain
    ```

3. Run It

    ```
    python main.py
    ```

This will create a basic blockchain with two sample transactions.
