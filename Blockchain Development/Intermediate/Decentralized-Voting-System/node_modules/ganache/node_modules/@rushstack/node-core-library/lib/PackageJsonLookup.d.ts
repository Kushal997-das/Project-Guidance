     * This function provides a concise and efficient way for an NPM package to report metadata about itself.
     * For example, a tool might want to report its version.
     *
     * The `loadOwnPackageJson()` probes upwards from the caller's folder, expecting to find a package.json file,
     * which is assumed to be the caller's package.  The result is cached, under the assumption that a tool's
     * own package.json (and intermediary folders) will never change during the lifetime of the process.
     *
     * @example
     * ```ts
     * // Report the version of our NPM package
     * const myPackageVersion: string = PackageJsonLookup.loadOwnPackageJson(__dirname).version;
     * console.log(`Cool Tool - Version ${myPackageVersion}`);

     * @returns This function always returns a valid `IPackageJson` object.  If any problems are encountered during
     * loading, an exception will be thrown instead.
