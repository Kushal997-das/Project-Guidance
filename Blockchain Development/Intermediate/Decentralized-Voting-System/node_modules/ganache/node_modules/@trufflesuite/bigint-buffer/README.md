### :construction: This is a fork!
This is a fork of the original [bigint-buffer](https://github.com/no2chem/bigint-buffer) by @no2chem. This fork prebuilds the binaries using [prebuildify](https://github.com/prebuild/prebuildify). The binaries are built (and tested) for win32, linux, and darwin platforms, node versions 10-16, and x64 architecture. This should allow windows users to use the utility without installing `windows-build-tools`.
