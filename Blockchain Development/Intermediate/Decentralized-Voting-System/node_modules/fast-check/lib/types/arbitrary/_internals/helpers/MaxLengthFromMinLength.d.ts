 * This size will be used to infer a bias to limit the depth, used as follow within recursive structures:
 * While going deeper, the bias on depth will increase the probability to generate small instances.
 *
 * When used with {@link Size}, the larger the size the deeper the structure.
 * When used with numeric values, the larger the number (floating point number &gt;= 0),

 * deep structures, while `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY` means "depth has no impact".

 * Using `max` or `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY` is fully equivalent.
