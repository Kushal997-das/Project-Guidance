## Flipbook
This project is a small stack of image-filled sheets of paper that reveal an animation when you flip through them. A flipbook is an interactive, HTML5 online publication that has the look and feel of a real, page-turning publication (complete with page-turning effects, page shadows and more). It can be used to replace conventional digital PDFs and paper-based documents such as reports, presentations, magazines, catalogs, brochures, books and more. A digital flipbook looks and feels exactly like a printed publication with pages that can be flipped and turned - without the cost of printing!
