                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                    language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                    objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                <br>
                <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                    language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
                    for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                        Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                        elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page
                        navigation.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript
                        on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                        database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or
                        perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW)</li>
                    <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                    <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the
                        main page about JavaScript.</li>

            <section class="main-section" id="Javascript_and_Java">
                <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
                <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
                    language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript
                    follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the
                    reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime
                    system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
                    JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The
                    prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual
                    objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can
                    be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
                <br>
                <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
                    classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                    protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types
                    are not explicitly typed.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
                <header>Hello world</header>
                <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript
                    code:</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
            greetMe("World");
          </code>
                </div>
                <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
                <header>Variables</header>
                <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
                    identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                    characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
                    characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
                <br>
                <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode
                    escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
                    _name.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="Declaring_Variables" class="main-section">
                <header>Declaring Variables</header>
                <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
                <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>
                var x = 42.
              </code>
                </div>
                <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
                <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>
                x = 42.
              </code>
                </div>
                <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
                    variant</p><br>
                <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>
                 let y = 13.
              </code>
                </div>
                <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
                <header>Variable scope</header>
                <p>
                    When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
                    global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
                    current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
                    called a local variable, because it is available only within that
                    function.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope;
                    rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or
                    global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following
                    code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global
                    context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case
                    is an if statement.
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
                    ECMAScript 2015.
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
            defined</code>
                </div>
    </div>
