# Firebase Web Codelab - Final code

This folder contains the final code of the [Firebase Web Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-web/).

You can use this app directly if you'd like to see the finished app but before you do follow the [Create a Firebase Project and Setup](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-web/#3) step of the Codelab instructions

If you'd like to follow the step by step codelab start with the [web-start](../web-start) directory.
