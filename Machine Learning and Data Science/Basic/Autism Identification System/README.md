# Autism Identification System

## Problem Statement
- **Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD)** is a neurodevelopmental condition that incurs significant healthcare costs. Early diagnosis can substantially reduce these costs and improve patient outcomes.
- Current ASD diagnostic procedures involve long wait times and are not cost-effective.
- There is a need for a **time-efficient and accessible ASD screening tool** to assist healthcare professionals and guide individuals toward pursuing formal clinical diagnosis.
- The objective is to leverage **machine learning techniques** to create a faster and more effective screening process.

## Tools and Algorithms
- You can use any tool of your choice (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel/SAP/SAS).
- **Programming Language Used**: Python
- **Main Tool Used**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Algorithms Implemented**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest Classifier

## Dataset
- The dataset for this project is included in the repository: [Data.csv](Data.csv)

### Dataset Description
The dataset contains information related to ASD screening. Below are the key features included in the dataset:

- `A1_Score`: Score for question A1 (binary: 0, 1)
- `A2_Score`: Score for question A2 (binary: 0, 1)
- `A3_Score`: Score for question A3 (binary: 0, 1)
- `A4_Score`: Score for question A4 (binary: 0, 1)
- `A5_Score`: Score for question A5 (binary: 0, 1)
- `A6_Score`: Score for question A6 (binary: 0, 1)
- `A7_Score`: Score for question A7 (binary: 0, 1)
- `A8_Score`: Score for question A8 (binary: 0, 1)
- `A9_Score`: Score for question A9 (binary: 0, 1)
- `A10_Score`: Score for question A10 (binary: 0, 1)
- `age`: Age of the individual
- `gender`: Gender of the individual
- `ethnicity`: Ethnicity of the individual
- `jundice`: Whether the individual had jaundice at birth (binary: yes, no)
- `austim`: Whether the individual has a family history of autism (binary: yes, no)
- `contry_of_res`: Country of residence
- `used_app_before`: Whether the individual has used an app for autism screening before (binary: yes, no)
- `result`: Result of the screening test (binary: 0, 1)
- `age_desc`: Age description
- `relation`: Relationship status
