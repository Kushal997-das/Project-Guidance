## Autism Identification System

### Problem Statement:
- **Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD)** is a neurodevelopmental condition that incurs significant healthcare costs. Early diagnosis can substantially reduce these costs and improve patient outcomes.
- Current ASD diagnostic procedures involve long wait times and are not cost-effective.
- There is a need for a **time-efficient and accessible ASD screening tool** to assist healthcare professionals and guide individuals toward pursuing formal clinical diagnosis.
- The objective is to leverage **machine learning techniques** to create a faster and more effective screening process.

### Tools and Algorithms:
- You can use any tool of your choice (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel/SAP/SAS).
- **Programming Language Used**: Python
- **Main Tool Used**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Algorithms Implemented**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest Classifier

### Dataset:
- The dataset for this project can be found here: [Dataset.csv](Machine Learning and Data Science/Intermediate/Autism Identification System/Data.csv)

### Solution:
- The project notebook can be accessed here: [Autism Identification System](Machine Learning and Data Science/Intermediate/Autism Identification System/autism_identification_notebook.ipynb)

### Project Details:

1. **Introduction**:
   - This project aims to develop an ASD screening tool using machine learning techniques to provide quick and accurate predictions.

2. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**:
   - Load and explore the dataset.
   - Handle missing values and encode categorical variables.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Implement and train three machine learning models: Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest.
   - Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Compare the performance of the models to determine the best one for ASD screening.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Summarize the findings and highlight the model that performs the best.
   - Discuss the potential impact of the screening tool in real-world healthcare settings.
