# Autism Identification System

## Problem Statement
- **Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD)** is a neurodevelopmental condition that incurs significant healthcare costs. Early diagnosis can substantially reduce these costs and improve patient outcomes.
- Current ASD diagnostic procedures involve long wait times and are not cost-effective.
- There is a need for a **time-efficient and accessible ASD screening tool** to assist healthcare professionals and guide individuals toward pursuing formal clinical diagnosis.
- The objective is to leverage **machine learning techniques** to create a faster and more effective screening process.

## Tools and Algorithms
- **Programming Language Used**: Python
- **Main Tool Used**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Algorithms Implemented**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest Classifier

## Dataset
- The dataset for this project is included in the repository: [Data.csv](Data.csv)

## Solution
- The project notebook can be accessed here: [Autism Identification System](autism_identification_notebook.ipynb)
