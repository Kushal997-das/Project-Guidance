**##Airbnb EDA Analysis**

Airbnb is an online marketplace and hospitality service that allows individuals to rent or lease short-term lodging, such as apartments, homes, cottages, and even individual rooms, to travelers. It was founded in 2008 and has since become one of the most prominent companies in the sharing economy, providing people with an alternative to traditional hotels and accommodations. Hosts can list their properties on Airbnb, and travelers can search and book these listings for short-term stays.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is necessary for Airbnb, as well as for any data-intensive business, for several reasons:
#Understanding the Data
