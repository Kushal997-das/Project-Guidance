# UBER ANALYSIS

Uber is an international company located in 69 countries and around 900 cities around the world. Lyft, on the other hand, operates in approximately 644 cities in the US and 12 cities in Canada alone. However, in the US, it is the second-largest passenger company with a market share of 31%.

From booking a taxi to paying a bill, both services have similar features. But there are some exceptions when the two passenger services reach the neck. The same goes for prices, especially Uber’s “surge” and “Prime Time” in Lyft. There are certain limitations that depend on where service providers are classified.

Many articles focus on algorithm/model learning, data purification, feature extraction, and fail to define the purpose of the model. Understanding the business model can help identify challenges that can be solved using analytics and scientific data. In this article, we go through the Uber Model, which provides a framework for end-to-end prediction analytics of Uber data prediction sources.
