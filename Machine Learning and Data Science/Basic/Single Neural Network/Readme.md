A single-layer neural network represents the most simple form of neural network, in which there is only one layer of input nodes that send weighted inputs to a subsequent layer of receiving nodes, or in some cases, one receiving node.
Perceptron is a machine learning algorithm that helps provide classified outcomes for computing. It dates back to the 1950s and represents a fundamental example of how machine learning algorithms work to develop data.
