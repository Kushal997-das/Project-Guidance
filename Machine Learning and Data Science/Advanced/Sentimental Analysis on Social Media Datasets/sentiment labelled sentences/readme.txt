The sentences come from three different websites/fields:

imdb.com
amazon.com
yelp.com

For each website, there exist 500 positive and 500 negative sentences. Those were selected randomly for larger datasets of reviews. 
We attempted to select sentences that have a clearly positive or negative connotaton, the goal was for no neutral sentences to be selected.
