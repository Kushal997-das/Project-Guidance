# Sentiment Analysis on Amazon, IMDb, and Yelp Datasets

## Introduction
This repository contains code for performing sentiment analysis on reviews from three different datasets: Amazon, IMDb, and Yelp. The goal is to classify the sentiment of each review as positive or negative.

## Problem Statement
Sentiment analysis is a significant task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. The main challenge is to accurately identify whether the sentiment in reviews is positive or negative, which can provide valuable insights for businesses and researchers.

## Solution
Our approach involves using machine learning techniques to build models that can classify reviews from Amazon, IMDb, and Yelp datasets. The solution includes:
- Data preprocessing to clean and prepare the text data.
- Feature extraction using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
- Training different machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and Neural Networks.
- Evaluating the performance of these models to select the best one.

## Datasets
The datasets used in this project are:
- **Amazon Reviews**: Contains reviews from Amazon with their associated sentiment.
- **IMDb Reviews**: Contains movie reviews from IMDb with their associated sentiment.
- **Yelp Reviews**: Contains business reviews from Yelp with their associated sentiment.

Each dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets.

## Evaluation
The evaluation source code provides metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the performance of the trained model. It outputs these metrics to the console.

## Results
The results of our experiments are summarized in the directory. This includes:
- Performance metrics for each model.
- Confusion matrices.
- Graphs showing training and validation accuracy/loss.

## Use Cases
Sentiment analysis has a wide range of applications, including:
- **Customer Feedback**: Understanding customer opinions from reviews to improve products or services.
- **Market Research**: Analyzing trends and sentiments in customer reviews for market insights.
- **Social Media Monitoring**: Tracking public sentiment about brands or topics on social media platforms.
- **Content Moderation**: Automatically detecting and managing offensive or inappropriate content in user reviews.
