> Problem Statement:
- Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition associated with significant healthcare costs, and early diagnosis can significantly reduce these. However, the current wait times for ASD diagnosis are prolonged, and existing procedures lack cost-effectiveness. <br>

- You can choose any of the tool of your choice
(Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel/SAP/SAS)<br>
- Here is the dataset :
