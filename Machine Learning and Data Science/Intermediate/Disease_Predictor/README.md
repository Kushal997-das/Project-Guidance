### **Discription**
  - Our project is a valuable and innovative Model that aims to provide a much-needed solution for people who may be unable to afford or access healthcare services. <br>
  - By using sophisticated algorithms and advanced data analysis techniques, our application can help users identify potential illnesses based on their symptoms.<br>
  - This technology has the potential to revolutionize the way people manage their health, particularly in areas where medical resources may be limited. <br>
  - This project is a shining example of how technology can be leveraged to make a positive impact on society, by improving access to critical health information and   empowering people to take control of their wellbeing.<br>
  - This will help mainly those people who are poor or dont have the luxury to visit the doctors.

### **Prerequists**
* Python is needed
* Tensorflow is needed. 
* Install any neccessary Library needed for model creation.

### **Installation**
* Assumuming the dataset(Testing.csv & Training.csv) is included in the same folder as `ml.ipynb`.<br>
* You just need to run the file the required partition and data pre processing will be done by the file itself.<br>
* All three of these files are neccessary for the working of the program. which will be created by `ml.ipynb` itself.
After that a `data_dict.pkl, final_nb_model.pkl, final_rf_model.pkl, final_svm_model.pkl, lamda.pkl` file will be created which will be used in the `implement.py`.
Now, just run the `implement.py` file.
<br>
> Accuracy: 100%
<br>

### Working
* This program runs in the terminal.
* This software has 3 models( Naive bayes, Random forest, Support Vector Machine ).
* With Majority voting the appropriate answer/Disease will be shown to the user.
* Current combined Accuracy is 100%.
* Plese read the comments from `ml.ipynb` to get better understanding of the model.
* Its simple to use just Run the python file `implement.py`.
* This project is maily made to help people who don't have money to visit doctor.
