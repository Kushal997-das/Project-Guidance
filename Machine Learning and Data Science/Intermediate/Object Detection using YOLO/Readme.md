# Object Detection using YOLOv3

## 🎯 Goal 
The main goal of this project is to demonstrate the use of the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm with OpenCV in Python to detect objects in images. The purpose of this project is to showcase the effectiveness of YOLOv3 in real-time object detection.

## 🧵 Dataset 
The dataset used in this project is the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset, which is a large-scale object detection dataset. The dataset can be downloaded from the official COCO website: https://cocodataset.org/#home.

## 🧾 Description 
This project uses the YOLOv3 algorithm to detect objects in images. The YOLOv3 model is pre-trained on the COCO dataset and is used to detect objects in real-time. The project uses OpenCV to load the YOLOv3 model and detect objects in images.

## 🧮 What I had done! Here are the step-by-step procedures of how the project works:

Loaded the YOLOv3 model using OpenCV.
Loaded the image to be detected.
Detected objects in the image using the YOLOv3 model.
Displayed the image with bounding boxes and labels using matplotlib.
🚀 Models Implemented The YOLOv3 algorithm is used in this project. YOLOv3 is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection algorithm that is widely used in computer vision tasks. It is chosen for its high accuracy and speed.

## 📚 Libraries Needed The following libraries are needed for this project:

OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis Results 
The output of the project is an image with detected objects highlighted by bounding boxes and class labels.

## 📈 Performance of the Models based on the Accuracy Scores 
The accuracy of the YOLOv3 model is not explicitly calculated in this project. However, the model is known to have high accuracy in object detection tasks.

## 📢 Conclusion 
The YOLOv3 algorithm is effective in detecting objects in images. The project demonstrates the use of YOLOv3 with OpenCV in Python to detect objects in real-time.
