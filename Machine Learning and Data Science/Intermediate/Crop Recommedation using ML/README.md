This web application deployed with streamlit assists farmers in selecting the optimal crop to cultivate, considering soil composition and environmental conditions. By providing information such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels, as well as temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall, users receive tailored recommendations for the most suitable crop out of a selection of 22 options.
