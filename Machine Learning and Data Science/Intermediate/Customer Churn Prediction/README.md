# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning solution to predict customer churn using three different algorithms: Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression. The model helps identify customers who are likely to discontinue services, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## Model Comparison

### Performance Metrics

| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | 
|--------------------|----------|-----------|
| Random Forest      | 0.87     | 0.83      | 
| XGBoost            | 0.88     | 0.86      | 
| Logistic Regression| 0.82     | 0.77      | 

### Key Findings
- XGBoost performed best overall with highest accuracy and AUC-ROC scores
- Random Forest showed comparable performance with slightly lower metrics
- Logistic Regression provided a good baseline but was outperformed by both ensemble methods
