> Problem Statement:
- Create a storyboard showing spread of Covid-19 cases in your country or any
region (Asia, Europe, BRICS etc) using Tableau, Power BI or SAP <br>

- Identify interesting patterns and possible reasons helping Covid-19 spread with
basic as well as advanced charts 

Abstract:This notebook is devoted to predicting the COVID-19 spread dynamics in the world using neural networks of different structures. We will see how to make predictions based on linear regression, back propagation, long short-term memory neural networks(LSTM) , autoregressive integrated moving average(ARIMA) and prophet.

>Steps or Stages:
>It consists of four stages:
- Download and preliminary analysis of data

- Linear Regression

- Back Propagation NN

- Long Short-Term Memory - LSTM

>In first stage we pre-prepare data for analysis:
-change the data types of columns

- Rows Filtering

- Elimination of Missing Data

- DataSet Transformation

- Data Normalization

>Prerequisites:
- Python

- Pandas

- Statistics

- NumPy

- Matplotlib

- Keras

- Scikit-Learn

Dataset:https://www.kaggle.com/shiv28/covidowid

About: We are doing forecasting on India and taking train:test = 7:3.
